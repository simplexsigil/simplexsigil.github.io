Changing environements are a challenge for modern deep learning based human action recognition. I focus on robust, domain invariant systems which observe humans during daily and non-daily actions and recognize their behaviour in order to improve robotic assistance systems for activities of daily living. 

In this field of research I am less interested in the performance within a specific datasets, but rather the performance across datasets: How much worse is the recognition accuracy under different lighting conditions, background sceneries or even slightly changing semantics of certain labels.

I finished my M.Sc. in Computer Science in 2021 and started my PhD at the <a href='https://cvhci.anthropomatik.kit.edu/'>CV:HCI Lab</a> afterwards, both at the <a href='https://www.kit.edu/'>Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)</a>. 
I am involved in the <a href='https://www.kit.edu/kit/pi_2020_092_jung-bleiben-im-alter-mit-assistenzrobotern.php'>JuBot Project</a> which develops robotic systems to support elderly people in everyday living situtations and which is funded by the <a href='https://www.carl-zeiss-stiftung.de/en/'>Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung</a>.

<!---Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
