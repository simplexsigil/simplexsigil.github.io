My research focuses on developing computer vision systems for accurate human activity recognition and motion analysis across diverse real-world environments like different variations of homes or workplaces. I leverage synthetic data from simulations to overcome limitations in real-world data collection such as sparse datasets or privacy concerns in data collection. A key challenge is bridging the "domain gap" between synthetic and real-world imagery, which I address through special algorithms and training techniques. As part of the <a href='https://www.jubot.kit.edu/index.php'>JuBot project</a> I make use of such systems to recognize human behaviour in order to improve robotic assistance systems for activities of daily living. 

In this field of research I am less interested in the performance within individual datasets, but rather the performance across datasets: How much worse is the recognition accuracy in real-world settings when training on synthetic data, under different lighting conditions, background sceneries or even slightly changing semantics of certain labels.

I finished my M.Sc. in Computer Science in 2021 and started my PhD at the <a href='https://cvhci.iar.kit.edu/'>CV:HCI Lab</a> afterwards, both at the <a href='https://www.kit.edu/'>Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)</a>. 
As a member of the <a href='https://www.jubot.kit.edu/index.php'>JuBot project</a>, my PhD candidate position is partially funded by the <a href='https://www.carl-zeiss-stiftung.de/en/'>Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung</a>.
